# Pages ‚Üí Focus Areas
Each Streamlit page is wired through `scene_*` handlers in `Dashboard/uhn_dashboard.py`. When editing, keep these priorities in mind:

1. 2_üó∫Ô∏è_Access_&_Coverage.py (`scene_access`): integrate the latest water/sewer access CSVs, keep ladders/zone grids aligned with filters, and make sure zone selections flow through every visual and download.
2. 3_üõ†Ô∏è_Service_Quality_&_Reliability.py (`scene_quality`): spotlight service reliability issues (DWQ, blockages, hours), respect sidebar filters, and pair charts with concise remediation notes.
3. 4_üíπ_Financial_Health.py (`scene_finance`): track revenue vs opex, NRW, and collection efficiency, preserve CSV exports, and guard derived metrics against divide-by-zero or type drift.
4. 5_‚ôªÔ∏è_Production.py (`scene_production`): monitor sanitation & reuse chain KPIs, highlight treatment or reuse gaps, and ensure efficiency metrics stay actionable.
