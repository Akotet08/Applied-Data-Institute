Utility Health Navigator — Scene Updates to Cover Full KPI Set
(Fusion 4) — TEXT SPEC FOR DEVELOPERS
===============================================================================

Purpose
-------
This update expands and formalizes the storyboard so that **every KPI** in the provided list is introduced in a concrete scene with: component placement, formula, direction of good performance, data source placeholder, update frequency, and a minimal mock-data schema.

Global Conventions
------------------
- Time grain: monthly for ops/finance/sanitation; annual for national/sector KPIs unless stated.
- Direction: ↑ good, ↓ good flags explicitly listed per KPI.
- Units: % unless otherwise stated; hours/day, l/c/d, KSh, m³, counts.
- Filters: {zone, date_range}; filters persist across scenes via FilterContext.
- Benchmarks (defaults – adjust per regulator): NRW ≤ 25, DWQ ≥ 95, Hours ≥ 22, Collection ≥ 95, O&M ≥ 150.
- Data sources (placeholders): {household_survey, utility_ops, utility_finance, lab_results, asset_register, national_accounts}.

Notes for Developers
--------------------
- All formulas should be computed in selector hooks (e.g., useMemo) from raw measures to keep inputs auditable.
- Units and denominators must be displayed in tooltips/footers for transparency.
- For “rate per 100km” vs “per 1000 connections”, expose a toggle (defaults to /100km).
- Add DataQualityBadge (complete/partial/missing) per chart based on presence of required numerators & denominators.
- Export to PDF should respect active filters (zone/date) and include a formula legend page.
